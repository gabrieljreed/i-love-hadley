        "note": "Today we went for a nice walk, which was really great, but on the way home, we realized that the car was smoking under the hood. We went into Jiffy Lube and it turns out that our radiator is completely broken, and they think it's because we have a blown head gasket. We ended up having to get the car towed to a dealership and we're probably looking at a few thousand dollars in repair costs.\n\nMy parents ordered some cookies to be delivered (they were just thinking about us and the incoming baby), and they were on our doorstep when we got home, so that was a real tender mercy to feel like we had people looking out for us.\n\nThis was super crappy, but when we eventually got home, Hadley and I just laid down in bed and I instantly felt better being with her. I think it's so amazing that I get to be with someone that just helps me feel like everything is going to be ok. Plus we got some delicious Indian food for dinner, so that always helps."

She's been feeling really sick from the baby, so it's been a little tricky finding things she wants to eat. I really love her and I'm so proud of her for being so stoic about the whole thing, it honestly seems miserable."

Suddenly, I got overwhelmed with an enormous love for her. I have never felt more love for another person in my entire life, and I almost started crying because of how much I love Hadley. \n\nIt was a really sacred, special experience for me, and one that I want to make sure I never forget. I know Hadley isn't too big on the church right now, but the fact that we're sealed together is one of the most meaningful and comforting things I think I could possibly think of. Whatever bad thing could happen to use in life, the one I would be the most worried about is losing Hadley, so knowing that no matter what does happen, we can continue to be together is amazing."

Hadley got me some really nice and thoughtful presents, and it really shows how much she loves and cares about me. I feel really lucky to have her in my life and cheering for me."

I'm so happy that I get do be with someone like that, I think that kind of connection is really unique and special. "

I think Hadley was really nervous going into it, but they told us that everything was very normal, and very boring, which is just what you want to hear. Everything is looking great! That was a big relief for me, and I think an even bigger relief for Hadley. It was so surreal to see it moving around, see its little heart beating, and to think that it's a real human in there! It's also a bit weird since the ultrasound makes it look so much bigger than it actually is, it's only the size of a tater tot."

I honestly had a really long and tiring week, it felt like every day I was just coming home and doing stuff until I went to bed, and I didn't have any fun time for myself. Hadley was just so nice and made sure I was all taken care of, and we had such a great time together. I'm so grateful to be with someone who cares about me so much and goes out of their way to take care of me, even though she's also tired and got a lot of stuff going on."

It was kind of silly, but overall super fun, I haven't done anything like that in a long time, and we had a really fun time driving over and getting them together. \n\nHadley was also super sweet tonight, she said she was really grateful for me and felt really lucky to have me in her life. I completely feel the same way. She also told me I look like a Greek statue when I get undressed, which is honestly something that nobody has ever told me before haha, but it was really kind of her."
